MkDocs includes two built-in themes ([mkdocs](#mkdocs) and
[readthedocs](#readthedocs)), as documented below. However, many [third party
themes] are available to choose from as well.

To choose a theme, set the [theme] configuration option in your `mkdocs.yml`
config file.

```yaml
theme:
    name: readthedocs
```

## mkdocs

The default theme, which was built as a custom [Bootstrap] theme, supports most
every feature of MkDocs.

In addition to the default [theme configuration options][theme], the `mkdocs` theme
supports the following options:

-   **`highlightjs`**: Enables highlighting of source code in code blocks using
    the [highlight.js] JavaScript library. Default: `True`.

-   **`hljs_style`**: The highlight.js library provides 79 different [styles]
    (color variations) for highlighting source code in code blocks. Set this to
    the name of the desired style. Default: `github`.

-   **`hljs_languages`**: By default, highlight.js only supports 23 common
    languages. List additional languages here to include support for them.

    ```yaml
    theme:
        name: mkdocs
        highlightjs: true
        hljs_languages:
            - yaml
            - rust
    ```

-   **`analytics`**: Defines configuration options for an analytics service.
    Currently, only Google Analytics v4 is supported via the `gtag` option.

    -   **`gtag`**: To enable Google Analytics, set to a Google Analytics v4
        tracking ID, which uses the `G-` format. See Google's documentation to
        [Set up Analytics for a website and/or app (GA4)][setup-ga4] or to
        [Upgrade to a Google Analytics 4 property][upgrade-ga4].

            ```yaml
            theme:
                name: mkdocs
                analytics:
                    gtag: G-ABC123
            ```

            When set to the default (`null`) Google Analytics is disabled for the
            site.

-   **`shortcuts`**: Defines keyboard shortcut keys.

    ```yaml
    theme:
        name: mkdocs
        shortcuts:
            help: 191 # ?
            next: 78 # n
            previous: 80 # p
            search: 83 # s
    ```

    All values must be numeric key codes. It is best to use keys which are
    available on all keyboards. You may use <https://keycode.info/> to determine
    the key code for a given key.

    -   **`help`**: Display a help modal which lists the keyboard shortcuts.
        Default: `191` (&quest;)

-   **`navigation_depth`**: The maximum depth of the navigation tree in the
    sidebar. Default: `2`.

-   **`nav_style`**: This adjusts the visual style for the top navigation bar; by
    default, this is set to `primary` (the default), but it can also be set to
    `dark` or `light`.

    ```yaml
    theme:
        name: mkdocs
        nav_style: dark
    ```

-   **`locale`**{ #mkdocs-locale }: The locale (language/location) used to
    build the theme. If your locale is not yet supported, it will fallback
    to the default.

    The following locales are supported by this theme:

    -   `de`: German

-   **`include_homepage_in_sidebar`**: Lists the homepage in the sidebar menu. As
    MkDocs requires that the homepage be listed in the `nav` configuration

    Default: `True`.

    page content as you scroll the page. Default: `True`.

-   **`locale`**{ #readthedocs-locale }: The locale (language/location) used to
    build the theme. If your locale is not yet supported, it will fallback
